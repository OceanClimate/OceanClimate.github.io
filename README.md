### Ocean-Climate Repository

Here you will find information on future group meetings, and slides/code from previous talks. The group meetings are run every Wednesday at 12pm, in the Wager room, Earth Sciences (sometimes the seminar rooms on the ground floor are used instead). 

If you have any queries or would like to change the schedule, the current organisers are as follows:

* Tom Bolton (thomas.bolton@oriel.ox.ac.uk)
* Jamie Parkinson (james.parkinson@jesus.ox.ac.uk)
* Chris MacMackin (christopher.macmackin@trinity.ox.ac.uk)

The current schedule for future group meetings [can be found in this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11S_bHZrkATnQsYqUyf3dwCsAEZUEdZSv06rGa5GjDLI/edit#gid=0). This information will hopefully have it's own sub-section on the webpage soon. For now, the schedule can be found below.
